### 🔄 Project Awareness & Context
- **Always read `PLANNING.md`** at the start of a new conversation to understand the project's architecture, goals, style, and constraints.
- **Check `TASK.md`** before starting a new task. If the task isn’t listed, add it with a brief description and today's date.
- **Use consistent naming conventions, file structure, and architecture patterns** as described in `PLANNING.md`.

### 📚 Project Dependencies Documentation
- query @https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/ for the latest ios swiftui documentation - make sure all generated code conforms to the latest specifications outlined in swiftUI framework version 13.0

### 🧱 Code Structure & Modularity
- **Never create a file longer than 500 lines of code.** If a file approaches this limit, refactor by splitting it into modules or helper files.
- **Organize code into clearly separated modules**, grouped by feature or responsibility.

### 🧪 Testing & Reliability
- **Always create unit tests for new features** (functions, classes, etc).
- **After updating any logic**, check whether existing unit tests need to be updated. If so, do it.
- **Tests should include at least:
  - 1 test for expected use
    - 1 edge case
      - 1 failure case

      ### ✅ Task Completion
      - **Mark completed tasks in `TASK.md`** immediately after finishing them.
      - Add new sub-tasks or TODOs discovered during development to `TASK.md` under a “Discovered During Work” section.

      ### 📚 Documentation & Explainability
      - **Update `README.md`** when new features are added, dependencies change, or setup steps are modified.
      - **Comment non-obvious code** and ensure everything is understandable to a mid-level developer.
      - When writing complex logic, **add an inline `# Reason:` comment** explaining the why, not just the what.

      ### 🧠 AI Behavior Rules
      - **Never assume missing context. Ask questions if uncertain.**
      - **Never hallucinate libraries or functions** – only use known, verified ios packages.
      - **Always confirm file paths and module names** exist before referencing them in code or tests.
      - **Never delete or overwrite existing code** unless explicitly instructed to or if part of a task from `TASK.md`
      - **Never try to build the code or run any tests**
