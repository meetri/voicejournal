# AI Enhancement Encryption Fix

## Problem
When AI enhancement runs asynchronously on journal entries with encrypted tags, the enhanced content (enhanced transcription and AI analysis) was being saved unencrypted to Core Data. This created a security vulnerability where sensitive content existed unencrypted between the time of enhancement and when the user applied an encrypted tag.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. AudioRecordingViewModel Enhancement
- Added encryption check after AI enhancement completes
- If entry has encrypted tag and key is available, enhanced text is encrypted immediately
- If entry only has base encryption, base encryption is applied
- Location: `/ViewModels/AudioRecordingViewModel.swift` lines 794-818

### 2. AIAnalysisView Enhancement  
- Added encryption check when saving AI analysis
- Both auto-save and manual save now encrypt content if needed
- Location: `/Views/AI/AIAnalysisView.swift` lines 161-185 and 216-240

### 3. Core Data Hook (Transcription+Extensions)
- Created new extension file for Transcription entity
- Override `willSave()` to automatically encrypt content when saved
- Added helper methods to check and ensure encryption
- Location: `/Models/Transcription+Extensions.swift` (new file)

### 4. JournalEntry Helper Methods
- Added `ensureContentEncryption()` method to verify encryption state
- Added `encryptContentWithKey()` for automatic re-encryption
- Location: `/Models/JournalEntry+Extensions.swift` lines 735-824

## How It Works

1. **Immediate Protection**: When AI enhancement completes, it checks if the entry has an encrypted tag and encrypts the content immediately if the key is available.

2. **Automatic Protection**: Core Data hooks ensure that any unencrypted content is encrypted when saved if the entry has an encrypted tag.

3. **Deferred Protection**: If the encryption key isn't available (tag not unlocked), content remains unencrypted but will be encrypted as soon as the tag is unlocked and content is saved.

## Security Considerations

- Content is only temporarily unencrypted while in memory during processing
- Once saved to Core Data, all content respects the entry's encryption status
- If encryption key is not available, system logs a warning but doesn't fail
- Base encryption is always applied as a minimum security layer

## Testing Recommendations

1. Create entry with encrypted tag applied
2. Run AI enhancement and verify content is encrypted
3. Create entry without tag, add encrypted tag later
4. Verify previously enhanced content gets encrypted
5. Test with locked/unlocked encrypted tags

## Future Improvements

1. Implement pre-encryption tag assignment
2. Add background task to periodically check and encrypt unencrypted content
3. Add UI indicators showing encryption status of AI enhancements
