# Encryption Key Access Fix

## Problem
The encryption key for encrypted tags was not available during background saves because:
1. The PIN was only stored temporarily in `EntryCreationView.encryptedTagPINs`
2. The key was not granted global access like in the settings screen
3. Background AI enhancement couldn't access the key to encrypt enhanced content

## Solution
Grant temporary access to the encrypted tag when the PIN is entered during recording creation, ensuring the encryption key is available for all background operations.

## Changes Made

### 1. EntryCreationView.swift
Added automatic key access grant when applying encrypted tag:
```swift
// First grant temporary access to the tag so the key is available for background operations
if EncryptedTagsAccessManager.shared.grantAccess(to: tag, with: pin) {
    print("ðŸ”‘ [EntryCreationView] Granted temporary access to encrypted tag")
}
```

### 2. Transcription+Extensions.swift
Improved Core Data hook to:
- Only process when there are actual changes
- Only warn about missing keys when there's unencrypted content
- Prevent unnecessary warnings during normal saves

### 3. AudioRecordingViewModel.swift
Enhanced logging and error handling:
- Log entry encryption status after save
- Better debugging info for encrypted tag status
- Clear messages about key availability

## How It Works Now

1. User enters PIN for encrypted tag during recording
2. System grants temporary access to the tag (stores key in memory)
3. Background AI enhancement can access the key to encrypt content
4. All saves have access to the encryption key
5. No unencrypted content remains in the database

## Benefits

- Consistent encryption throughout the app lifecycle
- Background operations can properly encrypt content
- Better error messages for debugging
- No security vulnerabilities from missing keys

## Important Note

The temporary access remains active for the session. When the app is locked or closed, all access is revoked as designed.
