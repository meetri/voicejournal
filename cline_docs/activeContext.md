# Voice Journal iOS App - Active Context

## Current Focus

As of April 29, 2025, the Voice Journal iOS app is in active development with a focus on completing Phase 3 (Journal Interface & Organization) while beginning preparations for Phase 4 (AI Integration) and Phase 5 (Polish & Finalization).

## Recent Changes

### Enhanced Waveform Visualization (April 28, 2025)
- Implemented multiple visualization styles for the waveform display
- Improved visibility and responsiveness of the waveform during recording
- Added customization options for waveform appearance

### Journal Entry UI Improvements (April 28, 2025)
- Enhanced journal entry details view with modern iOS design principles
- Improved layout and typography for better readability
- Added visual indicators for entries with audio recordings

### Bug Fixes (April 28, 2025)
- Fixed issue where voice recording save function created duplicate entries
- Resolved waveform display issues on first recording
- Corrected text highlighting for multiline text using AttributedHighlightableText

### Navigation Streamlining (April 28, 2025)
- Removed redundant Record tab for more intuitive navigation
- Consolidated recording functionality into the main journal interface
- Improved overall app flow and reduced navigation steps

## Current Work

### Memory Bank Initialization (April 29, 2025)
- Creating comprehensive documentation for the project
- Establishing a structured memory bank for project continuity
- Documenting product context, system patterns, technical details, and progress status

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
1. **Begin Tagging System Implementation**
   - Design tag data model extensions
   - Create tag management interface
   - Implement tag creation, editing, and deletion
   - Develop tag filtering and search functionality

2. **Start Calendar & Timeline Views**
   - Design calendar navigation component
   - Implement date-based entry filtering
   - Create visual indicators for entry types
   - Develop timeline view for chronological browsing

3. **Prepare for Mini-Player Development**
   - Research background audio session requirements
   - Design mini-player UI component
   - Plan integration with navigation system
   - Investigate lock screen controls implementation

### Technical Debt & Optimization
1. Conduct performance profiling of audio processing
2. Optimize Core Data fetch requests for larger journal collections
3. Review and refine error handling throughout the application
4. Enhance unit test coverage for recent features

### Planning for AI Integration
1. Research OpenAI API integration options for iOS
2. Design secure API key management system
3. Create preliminary models for journal analysis results
4. Plan UI for insights and analytics dashboard

## Current Challenges

1. **Background Audio Playback**
   - Need to implement proper audio session handling for background playback
   - Must design system for maintaining playback state across app navigation

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Waveform visualization is somewhat CPU-intensive during recording
   - Need to optimize for battery efficiency on longer recording sessions

3. **UI Polish**
   - Several views need animation and transition refinements
   - Empty states need to be designed for various scenarios

4. **Testing Coverage**
   - UI tests need to be implemented for critical user flows
   - Integration tests needed for upcoming API connections
