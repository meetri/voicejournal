# Voice Journal iOS App - Active Context

## Current Focus

As of April 29, 2025, the Voice Journal iOS app is in active development with a focus on completing Phase 3 (Journal Interface & Organization) while beginning preparations for Phase 4 (AI Integration) and Phase 5 (Polish & Finalization).

## Recent Changes

### Enhanced Waveform Visualization (April 28, 2025)
- Implemented multiple visualization styles for the waveform display
- Improved visibility and responsiveness of the waveform during recording
- Added customization options for waveform appearance

### Journal Entry UI Improvements (April 28, 2025)
- Enhanced journal entry details view with modern iOS design principles
- Improved layout and typography for better readability
- Added visual indicators for entries with audio recordings

### Bug Fixes (April 28, 2025)
- Fixed issue where voice recording save function created duplicate entries
- Resolved waveform display issues on first recording
- Corrected text highlighting for multiline text using AttributedHighlightableText

### Navigation Streamlining (April 28, 2025)
- Removed redundant Record tab for more intuitive navigation
- Consolidated recording functionality into the main journal interface
- Improved overall app flow and reduced navigation steps

### Tagging System Implementation (April 29, 2025)
- Created `Tag+Extensions.swift` with utility methods.
- Built `TagManagementView.swift` including `TagEditorView` for CRUD operations.
- Added `iconName` attribute to `Tag` entity (Core Data).
- Updated `TagEditorView` to support icon selection (SF Symbols).
- Integrated basic tag suggestions into `JournalEntryEditView.swift`.
- Enhanced tag filtering in `EnhancedJournalEntriesView.swift` to support multiple tags.
- Updated `EnhancedTagView` in `EnhancedJournalEntryView.swift` to display icons.
- Updated `EnhancedJournalEntryRow` to display tag icons.
- Enhanced tag suggestion logic with sophisticated algorithms for keyword extraction and category identification.
- Added comprehensive unit tests for tagging functionality in `TagTests.swift`.
- Implemented tag exclusion filtering to allow users to exclude entries with specific tags.
- Fixed code issues related to duplicate Color extension.

### Navigation Improvements (April 29, 2025)
- Restructured main tab bar to directly expose Timeline and Calendar views
- Removed the nested Journal organization tab structure
- Eliminated the List view since it was redundant with Timeline functionality
- Improved navigation hierarchy for more intuitive user experience

## Current Work

### Calendar & Timeline Views Implementation (April 29, 2025)
- ✅ Implemented calendar view with year, month, and week zoom levels
- ✅ Created timeline view with vertical feed-style display
- ✅ Added date range filtering options
- ✅ Implemented visual indicators for entries based on tags
- ✅ Integrated views into a tab-based navigation system

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
1. **Begin Mini-Player Development**
   - Research background audio session requirements
   - Design mini-player UI component
   - Plan integration with navigation system
   - Investigate lock screen controls implementation

2. **Prepare for Mini-Player Development**
   - Research background audio session requirements
   - Design mini-player UI component
   - Plan integration with navigation system
   - Investigate lock screen controls implementation

### Technical Debt & Optimization
1. Conduct performance profiling of audio processing
2. Optimize Core Data fetch requests for larger journal collections
3. Review and refine error handling throughout the application
4. Enhance unit test coverage for recent features

### Planning for AI Integration
1. Research OpenAI API integration options for iOS
2. Design secure API key management system
3. Create preliminary models for journal analysis results
4. Plan UI for insights and analytics dashboard

## Current Challenges

1. **Background Audio Playback**
   - Need to implement proper audio session handling for background playback
   - Must design system for maintaining playback state across app navigation

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Waveform visualization is somewhat CPU-intensive during recording
   - Need to optimize for battery efficiency on longer recording sessions

3. **UI Polish**
   - Several views need animation and transition refinements
   - Empty states need to be designed for various scenarios

4. **Testing Coverage**
   - UI tests need to be implemented for critical user flows
   - Integration tests needed for upcoming API connections
